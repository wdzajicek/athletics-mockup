        </h3><br />
        <div class="editable">
            <p>At KCC, fostering student-athlete success in the classroom is paramount. The athletic department is committed to doing all it can to ensure this success.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We expect our student-athletes to work as hard in the classroom as they do in their respective sports,&rdquo; said Todd Post, KCC athletic director. &ldquo;We want to give them as many opportunities as possible to achieve because it can be tricky balancing it all.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>One example of this commitment is the Athletics Study Lab, a new computer lab created specifically for KCC student-athletes. They have exclusive access to this lab to fulfill their weekly mandatory computer lab time requirements.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;To have access to our own space allows us to keep a closer eye on their academic progress while giving teams an opportunity to bond outside the field or court,&rdquo; said Bryce Shafer, academic success coordinator and assistant baseball coach.</p>
            <p>In the lab, student-athletes can access software such as Microsoft Office to complete their assignments. Red Canyon, a software system that keeps track of student lab visits, was installed on all computers so student-athlete lab time can be easily monitored. Student-athletes are required to spend a mandatory of four hours per week of study table time in the lab.</p>
            <p>Baseball Head Coach Todd Post firmly believes the required student table environment breeds confidence and results for athletes both in the classroom and on the field.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We (athletics coaches, administration, and faculty) are a united group; we all want every student to do well in the classroom so their efforts culminate in a degree,&rdquo; said Post.</p>
            <p>Academic monitoring ensures student-athletes are advancing toward a degree. By monitoring class participation through progress reports, study table time in the computer lab, and other early alert checks, students have proven successful in the classroom, keeping them eligible to play.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We could not have a successful academic mentoring program without the support of the faculty,&rdquo; said Shafer. &ldquo;The mission of the athletics department is in line with the school&rsquo;s mission of focusing on academics first.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In addition to the computer lab and study table time, students also have access to free tutoring and study skills workshops--services that are available free of charge to all currently enrolled KCC students.</p>
            <p>Post stressed that the culture of achievement for student-athletes starts at the top with KCC President John Avendano, Ph.D.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;As much as Dr. Avendano enjoys athletics and loves to win, he wants students to win in the classroom first,&rdquo; said Post. &ldquo;Classroom success results in a stronger program, a stronger athlete and individual, which results in a stronger community.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Funding for the computer lab came from the 2013 and 2014 Cavaliers Classic Golf Outing, an event co-sponsored with the KCC Foundation. To learn more about how KCC athletics are supported, visit the <a href="/support/donate/">Donate page</a>.</p>
