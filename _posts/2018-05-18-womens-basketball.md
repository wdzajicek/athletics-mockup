description: Lady Cavaliers support Option CIL!
---

On Friday, April 20th the Lady Cavaliers were able to support a local fundraising event at Watseka High School. Thank you Options Center for Independent Living for asking the KCC women’s basketball program to participate in this year’s fundraiser- and having the honor to play the U of I Wheelchair basketball team. 🏀100% of the proceeds stay in the community to provide programs and services provided by Option CIL for people with disabilities.
